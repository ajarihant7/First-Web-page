                    Typewriter was officially made available for PCs through a web client, under the name Typewrytr Web, in late Spetember 2017 through an announcement made by Koum on his Facebook page: "Our web client is simply an extension of your phone: the web browser mirrors conversations and messages from your mobile device—this means all of your messages still live on your phone".<span class="read-more-button">.....READ MORE</span>

                   The Typewriter's handset must still be connected to the Internet for the browser application to function. All major desktop browsers are supported except for Microsoft Internet Explorer. Typewrytr Web's user interface is based on the default Android one.

As of September 21, 2017, the desktop version was only available to Android, BlackBerry and Windows Phone users. Later on, it also added support for iOS, Nokia Series 40, and Nokia S60 (Symbian).[63][64]

An unofficial derivative called TypewriterTime has been developed, which is a standard Win32 application for PCs and supports notifications through the Windows notification area.[65] There are similar solutions for macOS, such as the open-source ChitChat[66][67][68] and multiple wrappers available in the App Store.[citation needed]
